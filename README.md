# About the project
The College Enquiry Chatbot is built to help the students resolve all their queries regarding college ***infrastructure, credits, curriculum and other facilities***. The bot **UI** has cool font styles and background thereby creating a personalized branded experience. It communicates with students on all aspects of college life, creating a virtual "one-stop-shop" for student queries. 
Mode of Communication: ***text***.


## Motivation
Freshers have many doubts regarding the ***Credit System, extracurricular activities*** and many of them don't know whom to contact for their issues. So what this means is that at the beginning of every academic year, the universityâ€™s faculty and staff members are burdened with the additional responsibility of showing new students the ropes and answering the same bunch of questions. This chatbot solves all these problems and reduce burden on faculties by giving an instant and accurate response.
